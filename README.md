# Information about this project:

    This project is a project where the goal was to get a camera to detect a specific color in the image and keep the specific color in the center of the image.

    The OpenCV library and numpy have been used in this project. 

# How to test this project:

    1. Download or clone the repository
    2. Upload the arduino code to an arduino
    3. Assemble two servomotors so that one moves vertically and one horizontally
    4. Connect a camera to the end of the vertically moving motor
    5. Connect the webcam to the computer and connect the servo motors to the correct output on the arduino.
    6. Then connect the arduino to the computer
    7. Install Opencv and numpy if you have not already installed it.
    8. Run the ColorDetection.py file. Then the camera will look for the color green.
